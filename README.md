# DSA - Sparse Matrix Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a sparse matrix data structure designed to optimize both memory usage and runtime efficiency when handling large matrices. The implementation includes methods for reading matrices from files, performing operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, and saving results back to files.

## Features

- **Sparse Matrix Representation**: Efficiently stores only non-zero elements to save memory.
- **Operations Supported**:
  - Addition of two sparse matrices
  - Subtraction of two sparse matrices
  - Multiplication of two sparse matrices
- **File Input/Output**: Load matrices from a specified file format and save results to files.
